## Project Overview

BackyardBarbellClub app is an iOS app designed to help users track their workout programs, manage nutrition, and analyze progress over time. This project serves as a demonstration of my skills in iOS development and incorporates key features to create a comprehensive fitness companion.

## Must-Have Features

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Enable users to sign up, sign in, and manage their accounts securely.

2. **Workout Tracking:**
   - Implement a user-friendly interface to log and track workout sessions, including exercises, sets, reps, and weights.

3. **Nutrition Tracking:**
   - Integrate a nutrition database or API to log and monitor daily food intake.

4. **Progress Analysis:**
   - Visualize user progress with charts and graphs based on workout and nutrition data.

5. **CoreData for Local Storage:**
   - Implement local data storage using CoreData for offline access.

6. **Firebase Integration:**
   - Integrate Firebase for user authentication and real-time data synchronization.

## Nice-to-Have Feature

- **Multimedia Integration:**
   - Enhance user engagement with multimedia content such as exercise demonstration videos or motivational quotes.
